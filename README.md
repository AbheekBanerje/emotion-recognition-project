# 😃 Emotion Recognition from Facial Images

This project builds a **deep learning-based emotion recognition system** that classifies human facial expressions into distinct emotional categories like **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Surprise**, **Neutral**, and more. Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the system learns to recognize subtle visual patterns from facial images.

It has practical applications in **mental health tracking**, **user experience analysis**, **AI avatars**, and **emotion-aware chatbots**.

## 📂 Dataset

- Can use publicly available datasets like **FER-2013**, **CK+**, or **JAFFE**
- Dataset should contain labeled facial images grouped into emotion classes

> 📦 Ensure the dataset is preprocessed: grayscale, cropped, and resized (e.g., 48x48 pixels)
